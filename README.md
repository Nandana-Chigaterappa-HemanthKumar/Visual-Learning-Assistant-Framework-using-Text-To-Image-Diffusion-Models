Visual Learning Assistant Framework
Text-to-Image Latent Diffusion Model for Educational Diagrams
📌 Overview
This project presents a specialized Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) pipeline designed to generate high-fidelity educational diagrams directly from text prompts. Unlike general-purpose diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), our lightweight approach is fine-tuned on structured educational datasets, producing curriculum-aligned, semantically accurate visuals to support learning and teaching.
Built using PyTorch and Hugging Face Diffusers, the framework integrates:
Fine-tuned Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for domain-specific latent representations
Text-conditioned U-Net (UNet2DConditionModel) with DDIM scheduler
Training optimizations: EMA, gradient accumulation, cosine LR scheduling, and noise augmentation
This system enables efficient inference on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU and supports further research on domain-specific diffusion models for education.
